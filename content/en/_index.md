  description: >
    Our group covers two roles: we provide support to internal and external researchers, and we do research on bioinformatics. Our research activity is focused on the development of novel computational techniques for the integration of cancer genomic data with clinical and pathological features. Our final goal is to translate this knowledge from cancer genome-scale studies to effective cancer patientâ€™s treatment.
