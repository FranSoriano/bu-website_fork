> Our lab and research are founded under principles that place cancer patients at the forefront, recognising their struggles and needs.

We work as a collective, placing the team's objectives above individual aspirations. In our view, the relationships are built on a foundation of trust, fostering an environment of mutual support and growth. We promote collaboration over cutthroat competition, valuing the constructive use of knowledge rather than using it as a tool to impose ourselves on others. We prioritise good judgement and consistent hard work over mere intelligence, drawing inspiration from the words of Spanish Nobel laureate **Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal**.

As social scientists, we hold a strong belief in supporting human rights and respecting the diversity of individuals, ensuring an inclusive environment where people from all walks of life, regardless of their gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other background, are welcomed and valued.

Science, for us, is not merely a detached endeavour; it is an integral part of our personal growth and creative expression. We strive to promote a harmonious integration of science, ethics, humanity, and work-life balance as well as fostering a deep respect and love for culture, including arts and humanities.

We are committed to upholding and integrating these principles into our daily work. Our dedication lies in making a positive impact, not only in the lives of the patients we serve but also within the broader scientific community and society.
