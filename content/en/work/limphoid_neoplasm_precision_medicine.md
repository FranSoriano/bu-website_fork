## A multi-center project to study agressive lymphoma

This is a multi-center project carried out in collaboration with Fundacion Jimenez Díaz, Fundación para la Investigación Hospital Puerta del Hierro, Centro Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa, Fundación MD Anderson and the Monoclonal Antibodies Unit from CNIO. The goal of the project is to effectively apply precision medicine for the treatment of aggressive lymphoma. To fulfil this task, we are integrating clinical and genomic data along with experimental models to identify new biomarkers for this disease. We are also studying the intrinsic tumoral heterogeneity, the interaction between the intratumoral molecular alterations and the modifications of the tumour stroma using bioinformatic approaches.
