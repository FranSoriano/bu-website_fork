## Towards better cancer therapies

Identifying the most appropriate therapies from cancer genome data is a major challenge in personalized cancer medicine. Physicians and researchers are faced with long lists of tumor-specific genomic variants where most variants are either clinically “unactionable”, their biological role unknown or they are irrelevant for tumor biology. Our group is interested in the development of novel bioinformatics methods to interpret genomic alterations, evaluate their clinical relevance and drug feasibility and provide a prioritized evidence-based list of tailored anticancer therapies to facilitate clinical decision making.
