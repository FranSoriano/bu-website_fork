## Gene dependencies and targeted therapies

Cancer precision medicine has achieved promising results in the clinical practice, although only a small fraction of patients present the particular biomarkers of drug sensitivity to take benefit of this approach. Our group is interested in identifying novel druggable cancer dependencies in order to expand the current catalogue of targeted therapies for cancer treatment.
