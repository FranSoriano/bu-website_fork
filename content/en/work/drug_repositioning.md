## Repurposing existing drugs for cancer treatment

Computational drug repositioning consists in finding new applications to already approved drugs by using computational methods. Our lab is interested in  drug-associated gene expression signatures coming from large pharmacogenomics projects, drug structural info and artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to infer new potential therapeutical applications, to predict cancer drug response and to infer synergistic combinations of antitumor drugs.
